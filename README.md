SPA (Single Page Application)
===
This repository contains files to build a vanilla JS based single page application (SPA).

The main objective is to learn how to create SPAs using pure Javascript and from there decide wheater to use a framework or not depending on the problem-situation to solve.

Dependencies
--
Although this project uses mainly pure javascript, some dependencies are needed to ease the developement.

These dependencies are:

* jQuery (http://jquery.com/)
* jQuery uriAnchor plugin (https://github.com/mmikowski/urianchor)

Shell modules
--
The architecture of this SPA is composed of modules named shells, each shell encapsulates a feature and serves as a feature container. This allows to decouple application features and provides modularity.
